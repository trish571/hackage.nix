A\nmonadic incremental interface is provided as well. This package\nrelies on Google's C implementation.\n\nThe following packages are based on this package and provide\nAPI support for popular streaming frameworks:\n\n* </package/brotli-streams brotli-streams> (for </package/io-streams io-streams>)\n\n* </package/pipes-brotli pipes-brotli> (for </package/pipes pipes>)\n\n* </package/brotli-conduit brotli-conduit> (for </package/conduit conduit>)\n";
